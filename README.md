# IoT and GPS-Supported Fall Detection and Notification System

Within the scope of the project, we developed a fall notification system to help protect human life. Thanks to this system, it is now possible to live safely at every step! The system not only instantly detects falls with its sensitive accelerometer but also accurately determines the location of the fall using GPS technology. These powerful features immediately notify users of the fall and its exact location, helping to prevent serious accidents and even fatal tragedies, while also increasing the chances of timely emergency intervention.

From a safety and protection perspective, this system not only saves the lives of individuals who have experienced accidents but also prevents serious injuries and disasters. With the ever-alert fall notification system, people are able to move freely in their daily lives while sparing their loved ones from unnecessary worry.

To protect every moment that matters to you, this system provides an indispensable safety measure, especially for elderly individuals, athletes, workers, and other at-risk groups. Thanks to the fall notification system, it is now possible to prevent the dangers that accidents may bring.
